## Purpose

I wanted to make a simple CRUD app on top of Django and React that would provide a surface for me to experiment with Tailwind on top of, as well as deepen my understanding of Django and React. The brevity of Tailwind’s declarative nature mirrored SwiftUI’s view modifiers (a pattern I like), and I wanted to explore using Tailwind within a project. I chose as simple a model as I could, to ease the logic so I could focus on API, Component and Tailwind declaration.
